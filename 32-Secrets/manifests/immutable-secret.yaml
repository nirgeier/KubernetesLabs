# immutable: true prevents any future updates to this Secret's data.
# Once set, the only way to change the Secret is to delete and recreate it.
# Benefits:
#   - Protects against accidental (or malicious) modifications
#   - Improves cluster performance by reducing watch load on the API server
#     (the kubelet does not need to watch immutable Secrets for changes)
