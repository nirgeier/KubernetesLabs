Welcome to the **Kubernetes Labs** repository! This is a comprehensive collection of hands-on labs designed to help you learn and master Kubernetes concepts, from basic deployments to advanced topics like Istio, ArgoCD and custom schedulers.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This lab series covers a wide range of `Kubernetes` topics:

- **Basics**: Namespaces, Deployments, Services and Rollouts
- **Storage**: DataStores, Persistent Volume Claims and StatefulSets
- **Networking**: Ingress Controllers and Service Mesh (Istio)

3. **Hands-On Practice**: Each lab includes practical exercises and examples
4. **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to modify the examples and see what happens

## 🎓 Lab Structure

Each lab includes:

- **Objectives**: What you'll learn in the lab
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Detailed walkthrough of concepts
- **Example YAML files**: Ready-to-use Kubernetes manifests
- **Verification steps**: How to confirm everything is working
- **Challenges**: Optional exercises to test your understanding
